# Frontend Mentor Challenges

My submissions for **[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)** challenges, meant as practice for me by going over **HTML** and **CSS**. ~~again~~


## Goals

- Learn the **[BEM](https://getbem.com/)** _(Block__Element--Modifier)_ CSS methodolgy
- Get used to **[SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)**
- Write better CSS **animations**
- Write more **semantic** HTML
- Use **"Vanilla" JavaScript** more often
- *Learn to have the patience* to write custom media queries **(Responsive Design)**

- _Maybe_ use [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org)

## Folder Structure

Every challenge will have its own folder and its own README. I'll also try to have them deployed on GitHub Pages.
